# Sign language word recognition
Machine Learning is a tool that has opened up a gigantic amount of new possibilities in all areas of research and technology development, in which it is data that helps to describe reality and understand how it works. On the other hand, at present, the gap that has marginalized people with special abilities is becoming smaller and smaller, increasing their possibilities and providing them with a simpler and fairer insertion into society. Thus, through the use of an electronic device embedded in a glove, designed at the USFQ to measure 11 signals in each movement made with the hand, an ML model is developed to classify each dataset taken with the glove so that it can recognize the gestures that a person can make in sign language. The dataset used consists of 21 gestures in sign language with approximately 20 examples of each, giving a total of 448 samples. The features used come from statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation and kurtosis applied to the signs that each gesture generated. Finally, it is important to take into account that the signals taken with the glove evolve over time, so the ideal solution would be to work with ML models that handle this type of data; however, the model presented only classifies the gestures.
